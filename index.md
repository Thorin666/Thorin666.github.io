# Education

I'm Yuke Lou, an undergraduate student (expected to graduate in 2023) from Turing Class, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Peking University.



# Research Experience
Currently, I'm conducting research at [Visual Computing And Learning (VCL) lab](http://vcl.pku.edu.cn/index.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Baoquan Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iHWtrEAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Prof. Libin Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=q7FiLBkAAAAJ). 

For my research interests, I am interested in the intersection of computer graphics and computer vision. In particular, my current research focuses on motion synthesis.
